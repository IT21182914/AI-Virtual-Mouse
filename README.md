# Introduction
### The AI Virtual Mouse is a Python-based project that uses Computer Vision and a pre-trained hand detection model (MediaPipe) to control the mouse pointer with hand gestures. This project eliminates the need for a physical mouse by leveraging real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to perform actions like mouse movement and clicking.

# Technologies Used
### Python: The core programming language for the application.
### MediaPipe: Pre-trained deep learning model for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
### OpenCV: For processing webcam input and handling real-time video frames.
### pynput: For controlling the mouse pointer and simulating clicks.
### NumPy: For numerical operations and interpolating hand movement to screen coordinates.
