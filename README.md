Introduction
The AI Virtual Mouse is a Python-based project that uses Computer Vision and a pre-trained hand detection model (MediaPipe) to control the mouse pointer with hand gestures. This project eliminates the need for a physical mouse by leveraging real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to perform actions like mouse movement and clicking.
